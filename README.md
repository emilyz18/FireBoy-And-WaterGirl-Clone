# Lavaboy and Hydrogirl

Two player game based on the popular game Fireboy and Watergirl. Use WASD keys to control Lavaboy, and the arrow keys to control Hydrogirl. Lavaboy can safely pass through lava but is vulnerable to water, while Hydrogirl can move through water unharmed but cannot touch lava. Ultilize the characters' unique traits to navigate the levels, avoid hazards, collect gems, and activate switches to ultimately reach the exit doors.
